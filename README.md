As a user , i am asked to pick one img from the set
As a user,when i clicked on the img the page will refresh and there will generate another set of imgs
As a user,after i clicked 25 times and page will show a bar chart to let me know the number i chose for each image
As a user,when i click the reset button ,the page will reload and clear the previous data.
